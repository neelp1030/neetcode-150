# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# given the beginning of a singly linked list head, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [0,1,2,3]
# Output: [3,2,1,0]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = []
# Output: []

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev, curr = None, head

        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
