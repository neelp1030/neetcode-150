# given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is a palindrome
# a palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward
# if there are multiple palindromic substrings that have the same length, return any one of them

# we try expanding a substring as far as possible starting from each character in the string s using a bottom-up approach (inherent DP)
